Data dictionaries for HCV-TARGET REDCap.

These use our SDTM-based variable naming system. When used in conjunction with the cdisc plugins in the redcap_plugins repository, it is possible to export data from REDCap to an SDTM-compliant data set.

As with all of the HCV-TARGET repos, no warranty either express or implied is made for the suitability of any of this code to a given purpose. I cannot guarantee it will work for you. I can also not guarantee that if it works today, it won't break tomorrow. Such is the nature of HCV-TARGET. So here is us, on the raggedy edge. Furthermore, some of it is derivative of others' work. Where this is the case, attributions have been made in the source code.
